Hi there, Welcome to PJ's Fun House.  Whack-A-Gopher is a point and click game where the objective is to click as many gophers as possible when they pop up from the holes.  We are planning to add add a leader board and also take care of an issue where the scoreboard doesnt keep up with the players score.  Also i do plan on changing the javascript to JQuery.  I just wanted to have it working first before i changed it. This sight was orginaly developed on 10/20/19 and was last updated 11/3/19. These games are Copyrighted by PEEJ Inc.
